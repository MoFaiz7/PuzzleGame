This project uses the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact) for state management between React components

## Configuration

Make sure to add your own `MONGOURI` from your [mLab](http://mlab.com) database in `config/keys.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: "YOUR_MONGO_URI_HERE",
  secretOrKey: "secret"
};
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
// Install dependencies for server & client
cd client
npm i
cd ..
cd server
npm i
npm run dev

// Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

Soft Skills to be tested:-
1) The skill pertaining to fine motor and hand-eye coordination are tested as the player manipulate puzzle pieces to put the puzzle together.
2) Player learns to work through a problem and reach a solution as they fit the pieces together. This tests the ability of problem solving of the player.
3) The process of putting together a puzzle has a finite end when the puzzle is solved. Player encounters frustration when they cannot easily solve a puzzle, and when they work through these emotions, they enjoy the success of task completion. Working through these feelings helps a player develop persistence, or the ability to keep going in the face of difficulty.
